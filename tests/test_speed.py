"""
Perform speed tests on the project to ensure performant parsing.

One of the main things that I set out to do with this project is
create a performant, feature-rich dice roller. To ensure that I
have reached that goal, we will include several tests to measure
this.

One issue though is that measuring this is not as straight
forward as simply measuring how quickly something is done timewise.
This is due to differing computer speeds. While this may run quickly
on my desktop, it may not run as well on Termux on an older phone.
